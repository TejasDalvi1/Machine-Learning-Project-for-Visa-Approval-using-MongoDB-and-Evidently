# Machine-Learning-Project-for-Visa-Approval-using-MongoDB-and-Evidently
===============================================================================
## Problem Statement

* OFLC processes job certification applications for employers bringing foreign workers to the U.S.
* Due to a high volume of applications last year, OFLC needs a machine learning model to shortlist visa applicants based on historical data.

## Project Goal:

* Build a classification model to predict visa approval based on the dataset.
* Use the model to recommend whether an applicant's visa should be certified or denied based on influential criteria.
